## ChatGPT Clone
This is a full-stack project I made using Next.js. This project is a complete working ChatGPT clone. I designed the whole GPT UI with Tailwind CSS myself. Here's what I used for this:
- Tailwind CSS: design
- Next.js: library

Specifically, my own library:
- [FreeGPT.js](https://freegpt.js.org/) : the stable free library for ChatGPT

Here are some screenshots too:

Have a try and a star. You can use my ChatGPT UI but make sure to thank me!

## Running
